#+TITLE: VLAN

* Setup

** Access Port: connecting routers with hosts

Switchport associated with a specific vlan.

Traffic within a switch can be managed without tagging?

** Trunk Port: connecting routers and pass all vlans to each other

When a switchport is configured to pass frames from all VLANs and tag them with the VLAN IDs it is called a trunk port.

Traffic between switches sharing vlan configurations needs to be tagged.

Receiving trunk port strips the vlan tags, end hosts do not see them.

*** Tagging Field

12bit, 1 - 4095. No 0.
